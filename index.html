        <p> Hello, this is the beginning of my <strong> <em> coding </em></strong>journey!
        For the past hour I was trying to figure out how to use git commit, turns out I was being silly but that is <em>irrelevant</em></p>

        <p>Anyway, back on topic. Recipes, I currently work as a chef and have a massive passion for cooking, my signature being <a href="./recipes/bolognese.html"><em>Bolognese</em></a></p>
        <a href="./recipes/bolognese.html">Bolognese Recipe</a>
