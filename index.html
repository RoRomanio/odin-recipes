        <p> Hello, this is the beginning of my <strong> <em> coding </em></strong>journey!
        For the past hour I was trying to figure out how to use git commit, turns out I was being silly but that is <em>irrelevant</em></p>

        <p>Anyway, back on topic. Recipes, I currently work as a chef and have a massive passion for cooking, my signature being <a href="./recipes/bolognese.html"><em>Bolognese.</em></a>
        But thats not it. below I listed my three top recipes I love to make, <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><a href="./recipes/bolognese.html">Bolognese</a></li>
            <li><a href="./recipes/beef_lo_mein.html">Beef Lo Mein</a></li>
            <li><a href="./recipes/carbonara.html">Carbonara</a></li>
        </ol>
        <P>If you are just getting started cooking, have an interest, or don't know what to make, I use 
            <a href="http://bbcgoodfood.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>BBC good food,</strong></a>
            this is a good place to come and see either what to make/ get ideas, and a good place learn various methods of cooking.
        </P>
