        <p>For this recipe, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 portions of Pasta (Spaghetti or linguine works but I recommend pappardelle)</li>
            <li>50g Pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>Gaunciale but bacon works</li>
            <li>Lots of pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step one</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a pot and fill with water, bring to a boil and add a big pinch of salt, then add your two portions of pasta.
                whilst this is happening finely grate 50g of pecorino into a bowl, add your 2 eggs and wisk together with a fork. once
                combined add lots of pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step two</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop your gauncial or bacon into small strips and fry in a seperate pan until golden and crispy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step three</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once your pasta is cooked, turn off the stove, strain and save a small amount of pasta water. 
                add your pasta back into the pot with your bacon, then dump into your cheese and egg slurry and mix together quickly to stop
                the eggs from scrambling. once done plate up and top with pecorino, <strong>Enjoy!</strong>  </li>
        </ol>
