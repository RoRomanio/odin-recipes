# odin-recipes
This is a project to create a website listing recipes, using features such as images, links etc.

Having finsihed the project, it has helped me using the git terminal, using git add, commit, and push.
It has helped with developing my knowledge of github, It has also made me experiment with using different features, such as making a button for homepage, I even made Beef lo mein html as a redirection page.
